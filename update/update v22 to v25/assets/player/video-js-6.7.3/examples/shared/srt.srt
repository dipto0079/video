1
00:00:49,217 --> 00:00:53,722
Mr. Director, this is
Agent Vivian Delay.

2
00:00:53,888 --> 00:00:57,517
For the last ten years,
the Central Intelligence Agency

3
00:00:57,684 --> 00:01:01,396
- has been after Wolfgang Braun.
- The Wolf.

4
00:01:01,563 --> 00:01:05,024
As you know, we have no positive
identification on what the Wolf looks like.

5
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:07,861
What we do know is
he's a former German national

6
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:11,364
who sells atomic material
to terrorists all over the world.

7
00:01:11,531 --> 00:01:15,118
Intelligence confirms that
a transaction is to take place

8
00:01:15,285 --> 00:01:17,829
next week in Belgrade.

9
00:01:17,996 --> 00:01:21,708
The Wolf's number one man,
the Albino,

10
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:24,169
will be selling a dirty bomb
to Syrian buyers.

11
00:01:25,754 --> 00:01:28,757
We've already dispatched
a team to eliminate the buyers,

12
00:01:28,923 --> 00:01:31,676
secure the bomb,
and apprehend the Albino.

13
00:01:34,137 --> 00:01:35,930
How may I be of service, sir?

14
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:38,057
Your target is the Wolf.

15
00:01:38,892 --> 00:01:41,478
We have reason to believe
he'll be present.

16
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:44,564
Find him and eliminate him.

17
00:01:44,731 --> 00:01:45,982
Yes, sir.

18
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:49,027
Let them get the Albino,
you get the Wolf.

19
00:01:52,363 --> 00:01:55,992
Oh, sir, if I may,

20
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,244
who is our agent on the ground?

21
00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:00,830
Ethan Renner.

22
00:02:00,997 --> 00:02:03,082
He's a lifer.

23
00:02:03,249 --> 00:02:04,876
He'll get the job done.

24
00:02:11,216 --> 00:02:13,551
The buyers have been neutralized.

25
00:02:13,885 --> 00:02:16,137
Well done, Ethan. Well done.

26
00:02:16,304 --> 00:02:17,806
Going down.

27
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:31,402
Maid service.
I have your extra towels.

28
00:02:52,298 --> 00:02:54,050
This cold is killing me.

29
00:02:56,678 --> 00:02:58,096
- Yeah?
- Where are you?

30
00:02:58,263 --> 00:03:00,306
- You left a big mess.
- Yeah, well...

31
00:03:01,432 --> 00:03:04,352
...I'm thinking about calling in sick.

32
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:07,397
Come on, you haven't had
a sick day in 32 years.

33
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,541
- Here's the scanner.
- Thank you, Yasmin.

34
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:33,798
Uh... be sure to stock my bedroom with those
little shampoo bottles, I like them.

35
00:03:35,967 --> 00:03:37,635
All teams in position.

36
00:04:10,043 --> 00:04:11,711
Excuse me.

37
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:32,148
Nice work in there, my man.

38
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:35,610
Oh... it's Zooey's birthday.

39
00:04:35,777 --> 00:04:37,028
I need a second to make a call.

40
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:38,947
Cell phones aren't secure, Ethan.

41
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:40,273
Yeah, well, it's my daughter.

42
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:42,951
You've got a payphone outside,
you've got five minutes.

43
00:04:49,207 --> 00:04:50,208
Let's see the scan.

44
00:04:53,962 --> 00:04:56,923
Hey, hey, listen I'm trying to
make a phone call over there and

45
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:00,843
I don't have any change so
if I could borrow some out of this money.

46
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,554
I can come back and I can pay you back.

47
00:05:05,515 --> 00:05:06,975
Come on, come on.

48
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:08,393
Son of a bitch.

49
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:15,149
All right, this is worth a lot.

50
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:16,609
I take some of this.

51
00:05:20,613 --> 00:05:22,031
I'm coming back for that.

52
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:36,629
Excuse me.

53
00:05:37,797 --> 00:05:39,507
Have we met before?

54
00:05:42,677 --> 00:05:44,303
You would remember me, no?

55
00:05:51,144 --> 00:05:53,020
Karachi!

56
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:57,150
Yasmin's been compromised.
We need to move now, Axel!

57
00:05:57,316 --> 00:05:59,026
No one moves on the Albino

58
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:02,238
until we have cleared what's in the box.
Come on.

59
00:06:02,405 --> 00:06:06,367
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We met in Karachi last April exactly.

60
00:06:06,534 --> 00:06:09,537
But then you were working
as a cocktail waitress

61
00:06:09,704 --> 00:06:12,039
if I remember it correctly?

62
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:20,298
- Oh, shit.
- We got confirmation.

63
00:06:20,465 --> 00:06:21,674
That's a dirty bomb.

64
00:06:27,263 --> 00:06:28,598
Boss.

65
00:06:28,765 --> 00:06:30,808
Abort.

66
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,422
- Hey.
- Hi sweetie, it's your father.

67
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:04,383
You didn't forget, which means
you probably love me.

68
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,802
Of course I do, Zooey.

69
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:09,764
You can prove it by singing me
"Happy Birthday," loudly.

70
00:07:09,931 --> 00:07:14,018
Well, I could sweetheart,
but, uh, I'm at work.

71
00:07:14,185 --> 00:07:15,903
<i>You can leave a message
after the beep.</i>

72
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:18,773
What the f...?

73
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:22,527
All right.

74
00:07:27,323 --> 00:07:30,368
Go, go! Get in position!
Cover me!

75
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:11,450
Cover Ethan now!

76
00:08:13,786 --> 00:08:16,122
We're going in!
We're going in!

77
00:08:32,237 --> 00:08:35,892
Cover Ethan! Cover Ethan!

78
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:06,983
All right, that's enough.

79
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:09,193
Put it down.

80
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,320
Put it down.

81
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,489
Now.

82
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:18,828
Now slide it over here.

83
00:10:18,995 --> 00:10:20,913
You're not going to kill me, are you?

84
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,791
Not unless I have to, all right?

85
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:27,294
But I'm not running
after you anymore, fucker.

86
00:10:37,096 --> 00:10:38,347
Ohh...

87
00:11:08,127 --> 00:11:10,379
I see you've read the report.

88
00:11:10,546 --> 00:11:13,424
- It's called Glioblastoma.
- Yeah.

89
00:11:13,591 --> 00:11:16,677
It's a type of brain cancer
and it's spread to your lungs.

90
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:18,804
It doesn't say
how much time I have left.

91
00:11:20,264 --> 00:11:23,809
Three months, possibly five.

92
00:11:23,976 --> 00:11:26,145
Yeah.

93
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:33,194
So, no Christmas this year, huh?

94
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,237
I'm afraid not.

95
00:11:35,404 --> 00:11:39,700
I suggest you put your affairs in order.

96
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:41,619
Thank you, doctor.

97
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,747
Well done securing the bomb, Ethan.

98
00:11:44,914 --> 00:11:48,334
But now that you're no longer operational,

99
00:11:48,501 --> 00:11:52,088
we need to terminate our relationship.

100
00:11:59,345 --> 00:12:01,680
We've wired your pension into your account.

101
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:04,433
The CIA thanks you
for your service.

102
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:47,995
What them?

103
00:14:11,352 --> 00:14:13,979
- What are you doing in my place?
- You do not speak French?

104
00:14:14,146 --> 00:14:16,899
No, I'm American. I...

105
00:14:18,234 --> 00:14:19,652
- I live here.
- Which floor?

106
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:21,403
No, I mean, I live here.

107
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:25,199
You? You are the owner?

108
00:14:25,366 --> 00:14:27,034
I'm so happy to finally meet you.

109
00:14:30,788 --> 00:14:32,081
<i>Bonjour, mon ami.</i>

110
00:14:32,248 --> 00:14:36,126
This is my wife, Teresa.
My son Abbate.

111
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:38,333
My daughter Sumia is in the kitchen,
she's pregnant.

112
00:14:38,337 --> 00:14:40,839
These are my cousins.
They are visiting us from Mali.

113
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:42,758
Until they go to stay with
my brother in Saint-Denis.

114
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:46,762
- Do you know Saint Denis?
- No, I don't know Saint Denis.

115
00:14:49,682 --> 00:14:52,601
- What are you doing in my apartment?
- We were without a home.

116
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:54,937
We were seeking shelter.
You are lucky we're here.

117
00:14:55,104 --> 00:14:58,023
- Bad spirit fill empty spaces.
- Yeah, but now I'm back.

118
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:01,402
And it is good that you are finally back.
My name is Jules.

119
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,028
Ethan.

120
00:15:05,406 --> 00:15:06,740
Where's all my stuff?

121
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:09,702
I also started to paint the room.

122
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:11,996
My wife think it is best to have
a cheerful color.

123
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:15,582
Is yellow good for you? I'm happy to do
the work. It's not a problem, Ethan.

124
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:18,377
Actually, Jules,
there is a problem.

125
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:28,387
That's months from now.

126
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:34,977
Then I guess I need to throw
them out myself.

127
00:15:35,144 --> 00:15:37,688
No, no, no, hey, no.

128
00:15:43,402 --> 00:15:45,446
I'll go to...
Hey! I'll go to jail?

129
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:48,991
All right, what exactly then
am I supposed to do?

130
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,791
Did you really just say that to me?

131
00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:05,424
Ethan, Ethan!

132
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:09,470
I need to talk to your dad.

133
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:12,139
Psst!

134
00:16:12,306 --> 00:16:14,641
Please give me a minute
to finish my call.

135
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:24,651
- I'm sorry, Ethan.
- Let's talk in private, Jules, in my room.

136
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:30,824
I can assure you, we have not
touched any of your things.

137
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:35,996
I'm not saying you did,
but I think it's time you and I

138
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:38,332
got to know each other
just a little better.

139
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:42,836
'Cause you're not just crashing
at some guy's house.

140
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:48,258
No problem, Ethan.
We will pack and leave now.

141
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:53,639
Where are you gonna go
with a pregnant kid?

142
00:16:55,474 --> 00:16:57,476
I don't know, but we'll
leave without packing.

143
00:16:57,643 --> 00:16:58,977
Sit down.

144
00:17:08,904 --> 00:17:11,490
You don't have to go yet,
Jules, at least...

145
00:17:11,657 --> 00:17:14,243
...not until your daughter
has her baby.

146
00:17:16,912 --> 00:17:19,581
But you stay under my rules.

147
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:23,710
- I am also a believer in rules.
- Rule number 1, no one steps in this room again.

148
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:27,256
No one. Absolutely.
I'll put a bigger sign.

149
00:17:27,423 --> 00:17:29,049
That's right,
you put a bigger sign.

150
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:33,137
Rule number 2, you always do what
I say, no questions asked.

151
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:35,264
Yes, of course.

152
00:17:35,431 --> 00:17:40,185
And rule number 3, you don't
ever paint my room again.

153
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:42,187
- You don't like the color?
- No.

154
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:45,190
I told my wife yellow
is not a man's color.

155
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:47,776
No, yellow is not
a man's color.

156
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:53,073
- So you also have a daughter?
- Yes.

157
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,993
Like Sumia.

158
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:01,373
Okay, okay, no more yellow.

159
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,726
Who is the most
beautiful girl in the world?

160
00:18:20,893 --> 00:18:22,436
- Is that you?
- Look, Daddy!

161
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:23,729
That is so cute!

162
00:18:29,902 --> 00:18:31,612
Run, run, run!

163
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:47,127
Hey, salut, Christine.

164
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:48,962
Hi, you.

165
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:54,551
Hey.

166
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:04,937
- This is Christine.
- Hello, Tina. It's me.

167
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:06,522
I'm in town.

168
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:12,486
I'm in a meeting right now,
so this is not a good time to talk.

169
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:17,199
I don't want to talk.
I want to see you.

170
00:19:17,366 --> 00:19:20,494
Yeah, I'm exceptionally busy,

171
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:23,330
so, uh... unless it's urgent

172
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:27,292
I've got some legal stuff I need you
to look at before I leave town.

173
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:28,752
Why?

174
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:33,590
- Are you getting married?
- No, why, are you?

175
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:37,052
No, not today.

176
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:39,888
All right, I'll meet you outside.

177
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:42,683
OK, see ya.

178
00:19:52,484 --> 00:19:54,361
Why are we really here, Ethan?

179
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:56,113
I wanted to see you.

180
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:03,036
And our daughter,
you want to see her too?

181
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:05,789
Yes. Yes.

182
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:09,835
I started a college fund.

183
00:20:10,002 --> 00:20:11,837
Why the sudden interest?

184
00:20:12,004 --> 00:20:15,257
It's not sudden, Tina.
I try to stay in touch.

185
00:20:15,424 --> 00:20:17,259
I left her a message
on her birthday.

186
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:22,848
Yes, and now she'll have to wait
another year to hear from you again.

187
00:20:23,015 --> 00:20:24,641
I'm dying, Tina.

188
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:28,312
- You think this is easy for me?
- No, I'm...

189
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:32,190
I'm sick.

190
00:20:34,318 --> 00:20:36,486
I mean, I'm dying.

191
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:40,574
Sorry it took so long,
but I'm afraid your will

192
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:43,994
must be signed
in both French and English.

193
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:51,543
I don't want Zooey to know,
at least not right away.

194
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:00,260
Come on in.

195
00:21:09,478 --> 00:21:11,271
It's nice.

196
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:14,941
The place looks better than before.

197
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:18,987
Don't look too hard.
It's falling apart.

198
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:21,782
I know I haven't done right
by you and Zooey.

199
00:21:24,076 --> 00:21:26,286
I want to see her before I go.

200
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,335
You have to make me a promise.

201
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:39,591
I'll let you see her under one condition.

202
00:21:41,843 --> 00:21:43,011
Are you done?

203
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:46,264
Are you really done working for them?

204
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:49,351
- Yes.
- Promise me.

205
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:54,398
Yes. I missed a lot.

206
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:01,571
I should have left a long time ago.

207
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:03,448
I'm gonna be fine.

208
00:22:03,615 --> 00:22:05,217
I've got the whole day planned.
First...

209
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:07,994
Oh, no, no, sweetheart, no.
She has her own plans.

210
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:10,414
You'll just have to catch up.
Hi, sweetie!

211
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,290
Hi.

212
00:22:16,086 --> 00:22:17,379
Hi, Zooey.

213
00:22:20,132 --> 00:22:21,341
How are you?

214
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,595
I'm good, how are you?

215
00:22:25,762 --> 00:22:27,556
I'm good, thank you.

216
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:31,435
- Okay.
- Mom, please don't cry. I'm fine.

217
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:34,938
No, I'm just... I'll be back home
at 8:30. Yeah?

218
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:36,565
What are we supposed to do?

219
00:22:36,732 --> 00:22:38,400
All right, how about I cook?

220
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,569
You're on.

221
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:45,991
So you want me to call you Dad
or should I just call you Ethan?

222
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:48,577
I think I like Dad.

223
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:52,372
Favorite place to go after school?

224
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:54,249
I didn't know
we had a favorite place.

225
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:56,793
Flying chairs, remember?

226
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,921
Look, Ethan, we don't need
to do this, all right?

227
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:02,549
I know you probably want to talk
and get to know each other.

228
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:04,968
That's why I transferred
back here to Paris.

229
00:23:05,135 --> 00:23:07,220
Look, I'm not mad at you,
all right?

230
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:10,932
I don't need you to explain any of this,
all right? It's not a big deal.

231
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:13,685
Come on, Zoe,
let's go to the cafe.

232
00:23:13,852 --> 00:23:16,521
Hugh, I want you to meet Ethan.

233
00:23:16,688 --> 00:23:17,981
Who?

234
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:20,859
- I'm Zooey's father.
- Oh! Hello.

235
00:23:24,321 --> 00:23:25,614
No.

236
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:31,036
Well, great to meet you,
Ethan... Mr. Renner.

237
00:23:31,203 --> 00:23:34,706
Sorry, sometimes
I just get a bit nervous

238
00:23:34,873 --> 00:23:37,167
when I see American cowboys.

239
00:23:38,627 --> 00:23:39,628
Yee-haw!

240
00:23:39,795 --> 00:23:41,129
Okay.

241
00:23:43,715 --> 00:23:45,050
He's older than you.

242
00:23:45,217 --> 00:23:46,676
Yeah, he's a senior.

243
00:23:46,843 --> 00:23:48,011
Is there something wrong with that?

244
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:50,222
Back when I was growing up if you...

245
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:52,057
Hugh is so different than you.

246
00:23:52,224 --> 00:23:55,060
Look, I know I'm blowing it here,
Zooey.

247
00:23:55,227 --> 00:23:59,022
Look, I thought you
might want to ride this home.

248
00:24:00,816 --> 00:24:02,859
- Wow, is this for me?
- Yeah.

249
00:24:03,026 --> 00:24:06,655
It's... so purple.

250
00:24:06,822 --> 00:24:08,281
Yeah, it's your favorite color.

251
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,699
Right, when I was like nine.

252
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:12,953
I'm taking the metro with my friends.

253
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:15,121
All right, so I'll see you
at home for dinner?

254
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:22,170
Zooey, I'll see you at home for dinner?

255
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,844
- How are these?
- Fresh.

256
00:25:11,011 --> 00:25:13,179
They're fresh?
I just need to steam them, right?

257
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:14,681
Don't forget to soak it in milk.

258
00:25:16,808 --> 00:25:18,059
Milk?

259
00:25:18,226 --> 00:25:20,103
Only if you plan to fry it.

260
00:25:20,729 --> 00:25:23,690
Haven't got that far.

261
00:25:25,317 --> 00:25:28,445
I like a man that doesn't pretend to know
his way around the kitchen.

262
00:25:28,612 --> 00:25:31,031
Yeah, well, you're talking
to the right guy.

263
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:32,198
Yes...

264
00:25:34,534 --> 00:25:35,994
...I think I am.

265
00:25:39,623 --> 00:25:42,375
Well, I'm soaking tuna in milk and

266
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:44,143
thanks to you,
frying it for my daughter.

267
00:25:44,294 --> 00:25:47,589
So today is Zooey's lucky day?

268
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:56,556
- What did you say your name was?
- You can call me Vivi.

269
00:25:56,723 --> 00:25:59,517
Nice running into you, Vivi,
but not interested.

270
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,818
Maybe we could talk?

271
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:17,577
My wife gave me this.

272
00:26:21,873 --> 00:26:25,043
Come on, cheri,
let's go for a drive.

273
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:31,132
All right,
but my bike's coming with me.

274
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:37,847
The bike's going with me.

275
00:26:42,477 --> 00:26:44,312
Who exactly do you work for, Vivi?

276
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:46,648
I work for the director of the CIA.

277
00:26:46,815 --> 00:26:48,733
Wouldn't know about the top shelf.

278
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,152
Serbia was my operation.

279
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:52,654
I was looking for the Wolf.

280
00:26:53,863 --> 00:26:55,865
We believe he was
at the hotel that day,

281
00:26:56,032 --> 00:26:57,367
and I believe that
you may have seen him.

282
00:26:57,534 --> 00:26:59,619
- Wait a minute.
- And I'm willing to bet

283
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:02,497
that when you see him again
you'll recognize him.

284
00:27:08,336 --> 00:27:09,879
I want you to come work for me.

285
00:27:10,046 --> 00:27:13,383
Not a chance.
I've already got plans.

286
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:15,802
Don't you think Zooey deserves
to have her daddy around

287
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:18,304
for more than just
a few measly months?

288
00:27:22,183 --> 00:27:23,226
Jesus!

289
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:26,813
That was really close.

290
00:27:27,689 --> 00:27:31,818
In exchange for your cleaning services,
I could offer you an experimental drug.

291
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:35,363
Interested?

292
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:38,742
This, Ethan,
could extend your life.

293
00:27:45,373 --> 00:27:46,583
Where's the literature?

294
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:49,294
You know, the test results.

295
00:27:53,757 --> 00:27:55,633
How come no one's told me
about this before?

296
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,344
Because you weren't worth
the cost of treatment.

297
00:27:58,511 --> 00:28:01,723
Wow. You make me feel so special.

298
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:04,517
- You weren't. But now you are.
- Why?

299
00:28:06,561 --> 00:28:09,439
Because you're sick and dead men
have nothing to lose.

300
00:28:09,606 --> 00:28:12,817
I have access to many things, Ethan,

301
00:28:12,984 --> 00:28:15,111
but only you can give me
access to the Wolf.

302
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:17,781
I need you to find him...

303
00:28:18,656 --> 00:28:19,866
...and I need you to kill him.

304
00:28:20,033 --> 00:28:23,453
So I buy back my life by killing for you?

305
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,622
When did you become so self-righteous?

306
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:28,583
Jesus Christ, I just wanna be sure
that we're talking about the same thing here.

307
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,026
You know, killing.

308
00:28:35,006 --> 00:28:38,301
There's a man inside that works
for the Wolf's accountant.

309
00:28:38,468 --> 00:28:40,053
I'm gonna need you
to start right away.

310
00:28:43,473 --> 00:28:45,850
Well, I got a fish to fry and I'm late.

311
00:28:46,017 --> 00:28:48,436
I can get you in home
in time for dinner, Ethan.

312
00:28:49,813 --> 00:28:51,147
Question is...

313
00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:54,234
...do you want your bike back?

314
00:29:04,285 --> 00:29:07,038
- Pretty public place.
- Meaning?

315
00:29:07,205 --> 00:29:08,832
Meaning a silencer would...

316
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:11,835
...be handy.

317
00:29:13,753 --> 00:29:15,380
So, how many guys
are we talking about?

318
00:29:15,547 --> 00:29:16,631
One.

319
00:29:18,883 --> 00:29:20,009
Knock 'em dead.

320
00:29:20,176 --> 00:29:23,096
Yeah, well, that's the point, isn't it?

321
00:29:53,668 --> 00:29:55,587
<i>- Allo?</i>

322
00:30:25,199 --> 00:30:26,451
Grenade!

323
00:31:04,572 --> 00:31:06,074
Pretty good for a jobber.

324
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:11,412
You said there'd be one guy,
not five.

325
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:12,997
Oops.

326
00:31:13,164 --> 00:31:16,709
But I did say keep the young man
with the mustache alive.

327
00:31:16,876 --> 00:31:18,503
What do you think
this guy looks like?

328
00:31:20,254 --> 00:31:21,839
- Middle-aged.
- Not a chance.

329
00:31:22,006 --> 00:31:24,300
- Tell her how old you are.
- I am...

330
00:31:24,467 --> 00:31:27,136
Make an effort, all right?
I'm trying to save your life.

331
00:31:27,303 --> 00:31:29,764
- Now tell her how old you are.
- I'm 32.

332
00:31:32,475 --> 00:31:35,103
- Middle-aged.
- Jesus Christ!

333
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:43,069
Now this... is a young man
with a mustache.

334
00:31:43,236 --> 00:31:45,446
No, that's a goatee.

335
00:31:45,613 --> 00:31:47,949
That's a mustache and some stubble.

336
00:31:48,533 --> 00:31:51,619
- That's a goatee.
- That's a goatee?

337
00:31:51,786 --> 00:31:54,372
That's a mustache, all right?
This is a goatee.

338
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:55,665
- That's a shadow.
- It looks French.

339
00:31:55,832 --> 00:31:57,153
- Since when?
- That's a goatee...

340
00:31:57,291 --> 00:31:58,793
What, from your century, grandpa?

341
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,336
Look at that, that's a mustache.

342
00:32:00,503 --> 00:32:02,383
All right, so what about
the rest of these guys?

343
00:32:02,547 --> 00:32:04,007
Hmm?
Oh my...

344
00:32:04,173 --> 00:32:05,883
Who are all these other guys here?

345
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:08,136
- I don't know.
- And that doesn't bother you?

346
00:32:08,302 --> 00:32:10,555
Nope.

347
00:32:10,722 --> 00:32:13,808
Because I usually like to know the person
I'm killing needs to be dead.

348
00:32:13,975 --> 00:32:16,375
And that's why you never made it
to the top shelf, my friend.

349
00:32:17,437 --> 00:32:18,688
Goatee, you're up.

350
00:32:18,855 --> 00:32:22,066
I'm looking for the accountant.
When does he get back to Paris?

351
00:32:22,233 --> 00:32:24,360
I don't know, I swear.

352
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,781
Kill him.

353
00:32:28,948 --> 00:32:31,200
Hold on,
I can get this guy to talk.

354
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,622
He didn't know.

355
00:32:37,915 --> 00:32:39,876
Goddamn it.

356
00:32:40,501 --> 00:32:42,837
Do you even have a line
that can't be crossed?

357
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:51,637
I'm gonna need a significant raise.

358
00:32:51,804 --> 00:32:54,807
I wanna leave my daughter
more than just my shit pension.

359
00:32:54,974 --> 00:32:57,810
Look, I'll close at 25 but I'm gonna
cap you to half a dozen kills.

360
00:32:57,977 --> 00:32:59,437
Half a dozen?

361
00:32:59,604 --> 00:33:01,439
I'm already halfway there.

362
00:33:01,606 --> 00:33:03,941
We've all been asked
to tighten our belts.

363
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:11,240
Don't take this the wrong way, Viv,
but you're not my type.

364
00:33:13,117 --> 00:33:14,535
I'm everybody's type.

365
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,167
- You... Are you sure this works?
- No.

366
00:33:21,334 --> 00:33:24,253
But I am sure that if you don't try it,
you'll be dead in two months.

367
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:30,176
It's 50 thousand, not 25.

368
00:33:30,343 --> 00:33:34,097
And you're giving me credit
for those three guys upstairs.

369
00:33:36,432 --> 00:33:38,434
And I'm also gonna want a...

370
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:42,188
I'm gonna need a million
dollar life insurance policy.

371
00:33:42,355 --> 00:33:44,524
Take it or leave it.

372
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,359
I'll take it.

373
00:33:48,444 --> 00:33:49,904
I like the package.

374
00:33:51,572 --> 00:33:53,991
All right, now do it.

375
00:33:59,622 --> 00:34:00,915
Breathe, Ethan.

376
00:34:02,667 --> 00:34:05,962
It will hit you morphine-quick.

377
00:34:14,345 --> 00:34:15,638
One way or another...

378
00:34:18,474 --> 00:34:20,184
...I will make you feel better.

379
00:34:51,924 --> 00:34:54,010
Don't forget to soak the fish.

380
00:35:00,349 --> 00:35:02,685
You promised me my bike.

381
00:35:10,902 --> 00:35:11,903
Zooey!

382
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:19,827
- Zooey! Are you okay?
- No, I'm not okay.

383
00:35:26,918 --> 00:35:28,252
Look at this.

384
00:35:29,754 --> 00:35:31,422
This looks terrible.

385
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:36,177
I think your...
Your hair?

386
00:35:36,344 --> 00:35:40,139
No, no.
Yes. Yes, my hair.

387
00:35:40,306 --> 00:35:42,934
I look like a freaking Chia Pet.

388
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:46,312
It looks, uh, awesome.

389
00:35:46,479 --> 00:35:47,688
- Really?
- Yeah.

390
00:35:47,855 --> 00:35:49,398
You think this can go to prom?

391
00:35:49,565 --> 00:35:51,525
Well, if you're going you might
as well take it with you.

392
00:35:51,692 --> 00:35:54,153
- Oh, is that some kind of joke?
- No, no, I mean...

393
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,238
All these times,
now's the time to say a joke?

394
00:35:56,405 --> 00:35:57,865
No, I mean, maybe...

395
00:35:58,741 --> 00:36:02,119
- Maybe we can fix your hair.
- Fix it? You can fix this?

396
00:36:02,286 --> 00:36:04,455
No, you can...
You could wash it...

397
00:36:04,622 --> 00:36:08,209
You could sleep on it and,
look, tomorrow it will be...

398
00:36:08,376 --> 00:36:11,629
It'll be back to normal,
all right? Maybe?

399
00:36:11,796 --> 00:36:13,714
- You really think so?
- Yeah.

400
00:36:13,881 --> 00:36:15,800
Why don't we
pick up some dinner?

401
00:36:19,428 --> 00:36:23,432
Hey. Don't offer to cook dinner
if you're going to be three hours late.

402
00:36:25,601 --> 00:36:27,937
Look, I'm sorry, Tina, but I was...

403
00:36:28,104 --> 00:36:31,315
Save it. I was crazy
to think I could count on you.

404
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,219
I was gonna ask you to look after Zooey
while I go to London for work.

405
00:36:35,286 --> 00:36:37,171
Then, go.

406
00:36:37,238 --> 00:36:39,156
Really, you should go,
I can handle it.

407
00:36:39,323 --> 00:36:42,159
You can't handle dinner.
How are you gonna handle a teenager?

408
00:36:42,326 --> 00:36:46,998
How about I just diffused
a major meltdown. Her hair, okay?

409
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:51,627
I have to take the first flight
out tomorrow morning.

410
00:36:51,794 --> 00:36:53,087
I'm calling a sitter.

411
00:36:55,756 --> 00:36:58,884
I was late because I found
a doctor who can help me.

412
00:37:00,094 --> 00:37:01,929
- What?
- There's, um...

413
00:37:02,096 --> 00:37:04,432
There's a specialist here
in Paris who has

414
00:37:04,598 --> 00:37:07,309
a experimental drug
she's willing to test on me.

415
00:37:10,855 --> 00:37:13,315
Experimental.

416
00:37:13,649 --> 00:37:15,026
What exactly does that mean?

417
00:37:15,192 --> 00:37:19,113
It means I might be able to spend a little
more time with you and Zooey.

418
00:37:19,947 --> 00:37:23,743
You should have called, Ethan,
because I was going to kill you.

419
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:31,042
Can we just, like, maybe quit
fighting for a second.

420
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:35,296
Maybe not talk about
killing someone? Me.

421
00:37:35,463 --> 00:37:39,467
I could grill us up some of this tuna.

422
00:37:39,633 --> 00:37:41,218
- Tuna?
- Yeah.

423
00:37:41,385 --> 00:37:43,512
- Tuna.
- With all that mercury?

424
00:37:44,263 --> 00:37:45,347
No way!

425
00:37:50,644 --> 00:37:52,271
You're gonna fix that door, right?

426
00:37:52,438 --> 00:37:54,482
Oh. Um...

427
00:37:55,399 --> 00:37:58,027
Yeah, that was a mistake.

428
00:37:58,194 --> 00:38:00,196
You haven't been here 24 hours.

429
00:38:02,531 --> 00:38:04,408
I hope the sofa is going
to be comfortable.

430
00:38:06,285 --> 00:38:09,371
Yeah. Better than a cot in Karachi.

431
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:16,462
Do you need something
to help you sleep?

432
00:38:18,339 --> 00:38:20,216
Yeah, I'm gonna need it now.

433
00:38:25,012 --> 00:38:26,097
You're terrible.

434
00:38:59,755 --> 00:39:01,423
I knew you would call.

435
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:03,050
What the hell did you give me?

436
00:39:03,217 --> 00:39:05,845
- You're not coming over?
- No. I'm dizzy.

437
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:09,223
My head... My head's dizzy.

438
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:11,600
Vivi.

439
00:39:16,063 --> 00:39:19,733
- Read the manual.
- Wait! I'm hallucinating.

440
00:39:20,568 --> 00:39:21,819
I'm hallucinating.

441
00:39:21,986 --> 00:39:23,737
- Take a shot of vodka.
- What?

442
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:26,407
Vodka. It'll take the edge off.

443
00:40:13,204 --> 00:40:14,330
Is everything okay?

444
00:40:16,749 --> 00:40:17,875
Yeah.

445
00:40:23,756 --> 00:40:27,092
- I had a little trouble finding the vodka.
- Huh.

446
00:40:30,512 --> 00:40:32,556
Listen, you can call me
anytime you want.

447
00:40:32,723 --> 00:40:35,226
It's only a one hour difference
between Paris and London.

448
00:40:35,392 --> 00:40:38,520
- There you are.
- And you can call me, too.

449
00:40:38,687 --> 00:40:40,314
- I love you.
- All right.

450
00:40:40,481 --> 00:40:42,691
I'll be back in a couple of days,
I'm running late.

451
00:40:42,858 --> 00:40:44,860
- Your daddy has a list.
- Kind of a big list.

452
00:40:45,027 --> 00:40:46,588
- Washing powder...
- I'll see you guys!

453
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:48,489
- Have fun!
- ...for black clothes.

454
00:40:48,656 --> 00:40:51,033
Zooey, come on, breakfast.

455
00:40:55,871 --> 00:40:58,707
Look at me. Come on.

456
00:40:58,874 --> 00:41:02,086
Just one time up here.
One time.

457
00:41:05,756 --> 00:41:06,840
Atta girl.

458
00:41:07,967 --> 00:41:09,051
Zooey!

459
00:41:15,766 --> 00:41:16,934
Oh.

460
00:41:17,101 --> 00:41:18,310
What?

461
00:41:18,477 --> 00:41:20,479
Wow, it's...

462
00:41:20,646 --> 00:41:22,398
- It's what?
- Geez.

463
00:41:22,564 --> 00:41:25,150
- So, what, Ethan?
- It's...

464
00:41:25,651 --> 00:41:28,153
It's so red.

465
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,863
Vivi?

466
00:41:31,282 --> 00:41:32,908
Are you going to get that?

467
00:41:33,075 --> 00:41:35,869
Sorry. Nobody important,
just my boss, Vivi.

468
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:38,263
Was she the one calling you
in the middle of the night?

469
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:42,167
We talk a lot because
we sell internationally.

470
00:41:42,334 --> 00:41:44,628
It's always daytime somewhere.

471
00:41:44,795 --> 00:41:47,881
All right, so now we've got
three days to kill.

472
00:41:48,048 --> 00:41:49,133
What are you doing?

473
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,843
It's called a ringtone, Ethan.

474
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:52,511
I'm giving you mine.

475
00:41:52,678 --> 00:41:54,555
Maybe we can talk more
than once a year.

476
00:41:57,975 --> 00:42:01,312
There. Welcome to this century.

477
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:06,692
Zooey. Zooey.

478
00:42:09,203 --> 00:42:11,071
Don't you want to ride
your bike to school?

479
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:14,742
You think Hugh's
gonna like my hair color?

480
00:42:14,908 --> 00:42:16,368
Yes, I do.

481
00:42:16,535 --> 00:42:17,703
- Really?
- Yes.

482
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:20,806
- You think he'll really love it?
- Well, if he cares about you he will.

483
00:42:20,873 --> 00:42:22,583
So you don't love it?

484
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:23,876
No.

485
00:42:24,043 --> 00:42:26,211
No, I mean, yes, Zooey.

486
00:42:26,378 --> 00:42:29,131
Zooey, I really love it.

487
00:42:30,424 --> 00:42:32,176
Awesome.

488
00:42:48,108 --> 00:42:50,194
I can see you don't
believe in the customary

489
00:42:50,361 --> 00:42:52,696
forty-eight-hour window between kills.

490
00:42:52,863 --> 00:42:55,324
Well, you only have three days left.

491
00:42:55,491 --> 00:42:58,035
I'm not getting into your car, Vivi.

492
00:42:58,202 --> 00:43:03,082
Not until I get a second opinion on that
whatever it was you gave me.

493
00:43:03,248 --> 00:43:06,835
- I told you it's kosher.
- No, it's not.

494
00:43:07,002 --> 00:43:08,420
- Aw.
- The manual says,

495
00:43:08,587 --> 00:43:10,547
if you'd bothered to read it,

496
00:43:10,714 --> 00:43:12,925
you'd find out if I can't keep
my heart rate lower,

497
00:43:13,092 --> 00:43:14,968
that shit's gonna act
like a hallucinogen.

498
00:43:15,135 --> 00:43:16,929
So keep your heart rate low.

499
00:43:17,096 --> 00:43:19,640
Yeah, well, it's kind of hard
with the job you got me doing.

500
00:43:26,939 --> 00:43:28,148
Get in the car already.

501
00:43:32,945 --> 00:43:34,696
I need you to locate
the Italian accountant

502
00:43:34,863 --> 00:43:37,074
who cooks the books
for your old friend the Albino.

503
00:43:39,618 --> 00:43:42,371
How am I supposed to locate this guy?

504
00:43:42,538 --> 00:43:46,041
With the help of this man.
His name is Mitat Yilmaz.

505
00:43:46,208 --> 00:43:48,919
He runs a limo service
that caters to the Albino.

506
00:43:52,047 --> 00:43:54,383
Get to know him, he'll lead you
straight to the accountant.

507
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:56,385
All right.

508
00:43:56,552 --> 00:43:58,053
- And, Ethan?
- Yeah?

509
00:43:58,220 --> 00:43:59,638
Lose the bike.

510
00:43:59,805 --> 00:44:02,933
- Buy a suit.
- Why?

511
00:44:16,905 --> 00:44:20,909
So, you understand we are
a luxury car service, right?

512
00:44:21,076 --> 00:44:23,120
- Yeah.
- How did you come to hear of us?

513
00:44:23,287 --> 00:44:24,454
An Albino told me.

514
00:44:26,248 --> 00:44:29,668
Did he also tell you
that we offer discreet luxury?

515
00:44:29,835 --> 00:44:34,798
He told me not to talk to the hired help,
to talk to the boss.

516
00:44:34,965 --> 00:44:37,926
We're not the help, okay?
We are the executive vice president of sales.

517
00:44:38,093 --> 00:44:39,887
Ooohh!

518
00:44:40,804 --> 00:44:42,222
You're a couple of turds.

519
00:44:50,564 --> 00:44:52,524
Listen, asshole...

520
00:44:52,691 --> 00:44:56,403
...little piece of turd,
you're nobody to us.

521
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:58,405
And you will never meet the boss.
Understand?

522
00:44:58,572 --> 00:44:59,573
All right, I'm sorry.

523
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:00,532
Yeah.

524
00:45:00,699 --> 00:45:02,951
I had a really weird night,
you know,

525
00:45:03,118 --> 00:45:05,245
a couple of weird nights.
Jetlagged.

526
00:45:05,412 --> 00:45:07,664
I think maybe we got
off on the wrong foot. My fault.

527
00:45:07,831 --> 00:45:09,416
Yeah.

528
00:45:09,583 --> 00:45:11,168
Can we start again?

529
00:45:13,795 --> 00:45:15,464
Let's start again.

530
00:45:15,631 --> 00:45:18,008
Jesus Christ, I'm starting to think
you can see the Eiffel Tower from

531
00:45:18,175 --> 00:45:19,718
everywhere in this town.

532
00:45:52,167 --> 00:45:55,128
You are a very rude man
to sit behind my desk

533
00:45:55,295 --> 00:45:58,340
without an invitation, Mr...?

534
00:45:58,507 --> 00:46:00,342
Why are names important right now?

535
00:46:00,509 --> 00:46:02,052
Because I don't want
to kill a total stranger.

536
00:46:02,219 --> 00:46:04,012
What do you want
to kill me for, Mitat?

537
00:46:06,556 --> 00:46:08,433
You are sitting in my chair.

538
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,060
I'm just waiting for you.

539
00:46:21,571 --> 00:46:24,074
The Albino sent you, huh?
Bastard!

540
00:46:24,241 --> 00:46:26,702
I've always been loyal.
Please...

541
00:46:30,372 --> 00:46:33,500
- These your girls in the picture?
- How dare you look at them?!

542
00:46:33,667 --> 00:46:37,462
Sit down.
I also have a pretty teenage daughter.

543
00:46:37,629 --> 00:46:40,674
Father to father,
your girls ever

544
00:46:40,841 --> 00:46:43,552
lock themselves in their room,
you know?

545
00:46:43,719 --> 00:46:46,638
Cut their hair, paint it red, you know?

546
00:46:46,805 --> 00:46:49,016
Put wigs on and shit like that?

547
00:46:50,142 --> 00:46:51,393
No. Never.

548
00:46:52,978 --> 00:46:55,397
I knew it! I'm in trouble.

549
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:02,863
- So the Albino didn't send you to kill me?
- No.

550
00:47:06,033 --> 00:47:07,325
Then who are you?

551
00:47:09,995 --> 00:47:12,039
Ethan. Come on.

552
00:47:30,557 --> 00:47:33,018
I'm gonna have a conversation
with this man in the bathroom.

553
00:47:33,185 --> 00:47:35,687
I do not want to be disturbed.

554
00:47:35,854 --> 00:47:39,983
Yes. Rule number 2:
Do whatever you say.

555
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:41,526
That's right, Rule number 2.

556
00:47:41,693 --> 00:47:44,029
- He's a bad guy?
- Something like that.

557
00:47:44,196 --> 00:47:46,239
And you are a good guy?

558
00:47:52,662 --> 00:47:54,456
You are a professional, huh?

559
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:56,917
Why have I never seen you
in Paris before?

560
00:47:57,084 --> 00:47:59,252
I've been away on business
for about five years.

561
00:47:59,419 --> 00:48:03,048
What is so important that you'd
leave your daughter so long?

562
00:48:06,134 --> 00:48:09,846
Well, I was never good
at balancing work and family.

563
00:48:13,475 --> 00:48:15,268
You know, when I go home,

564
00:48:15,435 --> 00:48:19,606
this life, the killing,
the rest it all disappears.

565
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:23,985
I made the wrong choice leaving.

566
00:48:26,196 --> 00:48:29,950
Everyday I bring my girls to school
and I have dinner with my family.

567
00:48:30,117 --> 00:48:30,951
That's the key.

568
00:48:31,493 --> 00:48:33,620
Oh, good for you, Mitat.

569
00:48:33,787 --> 00:48:35,831
So let's not miss dinner tonight, hmm?

570
00:48:35,997 --> 00:48:41,419
When is the accountant
arriving in Paris?

571
00:48:43,255 --> 00:48:46,299
Please remind me,
who is he again?

572
00:48:57,811 --> 00:49:00,522
- Hello?
- Hello, Mrs. Driskal here.

573
00:49:00,689 --> 00:49:02,691
I'd like to have a word with
Zooey's father.

574
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,947
I'm Zooey's father.
Is she all right?

575
00:49:09,114 --> 00:49:11,199
Zooey's fine,
but we need to meet.

576
00:49:11,366 --> 00:49:14,161
We need to have a conversation
about Zooey's behavior.

577
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:19,124
- I can be there right away.
- Well, do hurry.

578
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:24,629
We're going to school.

579
00:49:24,963 --> 00:49:26,548
As I was saying to Zooey,

580
00:49:26,715 --> 00:49:29,092
study after study has shown that

581
00:49:29,259 --> 00:49:33,680
aggression is exacerbated
by violent images in popular culture.

582
00:49:33,847 --> 00:49:36,099
Well, Zooey's mother
raised her to be a pacifist.

583
00:49:36,266 --> 00:49:37,434
Hm.

584
00:49:37,601 --> 00:49:41,730
Hitting a classmate in the face
is hardly a passive response.

585
00:49:47,402 --> 00:49:50,614
With an open hand
or a clenched fist?

586
00:49:51,531 --> 00:49:54,743
- What difference does that make?
- Well, from my experience,

587
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:58,288
anger, frustration, insult,
they all call for...

588
00:49:58,455 --> 00:50:00,207
...they all call for different responses.

589
00:50:02,209 --> 00:50:04,544
Mr. Renner, it's extremely important

590
00:50:04,711 --> 00:50:07,380
that you send your daughter
a clear message

591
00:50:07,547 --> 00:50:11,218
that no matter what she
has to confront in life

592
00:50:11,384 --> 00:50:15,513
violence is not
an acceptable answer.

593
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:16,973
I'll try.

594
00:50:22,938 --> 00:50:25,832
If that wasn't so weird, it would have
been really embarrassing, Ethan.

595
00:50:25,899 --> 00:50:27,609
- Let me see your hand.
- What?

596
00:50:27,776 --> 00:50:29,402
Let me see your hand, Zooey.

597
00:50:31,238 --> 00:50:32,989
Ow, my thumb.

598
00:50:33,156 --> 00:50:35,158
If you're gonna hit someone
with a clenched fist

599
00:50:35,325 --> 00:50:38,536
be sure to not tuck your thumb in.

600
00:50:38,703 --> 00:50:42,123
You've been gone for five years
and this is what you say to me?

601
00:50:46,461 --> 00:50:48,880
Oh, God.

602
00:50:54,678 --> 00:50:56,179
- Are you Muslim?
- No.

603
00:50:56,346 --> 00:50:57,889
I told you this is my boss's car.

604
00:50:58,056 --> 00:51:00,433
- Oh, so Vivi's Muslim?
- No.

605
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:03,895
- I'm plugging in my phone. This stuff sucks.
- I know.

606
00:51:05,814 --> 00:51:08,650
I like this,
who are these guys?

607
00:51:08,817 --> 00:51:11,778
- Do you even care why I got into a fight?
- Let me out!

608
00:51:13,488 --> 00:51:16,157
Why can't you just listen to me
and try to understand?

609
00:51:16,324 --> 00:51:18,159
OK, why don't you tell me all about it?

610
00:51:19,953 --> 00:51:22,289
I have a new friend from Pakistan,

611
00:51:22,455 --> 00:51:25,792
and there's this British girl
who keeps calling her Paki.

612
00:51:25,959 --> 00:51:28,753
Today she put bacon in her locker,
so I hit her in the face.

613
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,839
Well, she won't do that again, will she?

614
00:51:33,883 --> 00:51:37,971
Just a second, sweetie,
sounds like the spare's loose in the trunk.

615
00:51:39,222 --> 00:51:40,432
Hey!

616
00:51:42,392 --> 00:51:44,644
I'm trying to have a conversation
with my daughter.

617
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:50,608
I'm... I'm sorry, sweetie,
now where were we?

618
00:51:50,775 --> 00:51:53,987
- Punching the girl, right?
- I feel really bad.

619
00:51:54,154 --> 00:51:58,241
Well, don't, because sometimes
it's the only way to stop a bad guy.

620
00:51:58,408 --> 00:52:01,119
- So you're not mad at me?
- No, I'm not mad at you.

621
00:52:01,286 --> 00:52:03,127
I'm proud of you,
you stuck up for your friend.

622
00:52:04,164 --> 00:52:05,915
Whatever. I'm taking the metro.

623
00:52:07,208 --> 00:52:08,710
- And, Ethan?
- Yeah.

624
00:52:08,877 --> 00:52:12,005
You might want to take something
for that cough. It's really annoying.

625
00:52:14,591 --> 00:52:15,717
Jesus Christ!

626
00:52:19,179 --> 00:52:21,514
Let's see if we can
jump start your memory, Mitat.

627
00:52:30,565 --> 00:52:33,143
It's my daughter.

628
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:36,738
- Zooey?
- Hey. Sorry about earlier.

629
00:52:36,905 --> 00:52:39,866
That's okay, honey.
I'm sorry, too.

630
00:52:41,159 --> 00:52:43,328
Favorite place to hang out after school?

631
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:49,626
I'll wrap my sales meeting
and meet you at 3:30, sweetie.

632
00:52:52,462 --> 00:52:55,131
She just invited me to hang out.
What do you think about that?

633
00:52:55,882 --> 00:52:58,635
A girl like this will keep you
running in circles.

634
00:52:58,802 --> 00:53:01,888
You must draw the line,
not be so soft.

635
00:53:04,641 --> 00:53:06,351
You're right, Mitat.

636
00:53:08,436 --> 00:53:10,021
I have been way too soft.

637
00:53:12,524 --> 00:53:15,276
Now, where do I find
the Albino's accountant, hmm?

638
00:54:26,014 --> 00:54:27,140
Hi, Zooey.

639
00:54:27,307 --> 00:54:29,350
It's 3:40, Ethan.
Where are you?

640
00:54:29,517 --> 00:54:31,603
I'm on my bike, sweetie.

641
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:33,479
Forget it, you're always late.
I'm leaving.

642
00:54:33,646 --> 00:54:35,940
No, no, no, I'm almost there,
honestly, Zooey.

643
00:54:36,107 --> 00:54:37,567
Give me...

644
00:54:38,818 --> 00:54:40,278
Give me five minutes.

645
00:54:40,445 --> 00:54:43,198
Fine, five minutes.
I have homework.

646
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:46,034
Wow.

647
00:54:48,244 --> 00:54:49,287
Kids.

648
00:55:18,191 --> 00:55:20,068
Sorry I freaked out earlier.

649
00:55:20,235 --> 00:55:24,572
It's just Hugh and the prom
and you came into town.

650
00:55:24,739 --> 00:55:27,408
This is really new for both of us.
I get it.

651
00:55:27,575 --> 00:55:31,329
So, favorite place to go after
Flying Chairs, you remember?

652
00:55:31,496 --> 00:55:32,747
- I remember.
- Kind of?

653
00:55:32,914 --> 00:55:34,415
- Yeah.
- Okay.

654
00:55:35,241 --> 00:55:37,710
Gosh, the bike.

655
00:56:02,110 --> 00:56:03,736
What's going on, Ethan?

656
00:56:06,281 --> 00:56:09,033
It's just some flu I picked up.

657
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,202
Can't seem to shake it off.

658
00:56:11,369 --> 00:56:12,595
What if it's something worse?

659
00:56:13,746 --> 00:56:15,623
No, it's, uh...

660
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:18,626
It's nothing worse.

661
00:56:20,336 --> 00:56:23,006
You remember when we'd drink
hot chocolate at the beach house?

662
00:56:23,172 --> 00:56:24,507
Sort of.

663
00:56:24,674 --> 00:56:26,651
It's the one place I wouldn't
mind calling home.

664
00:56:26,718 --> 00:56:29,370
- More than Pittsburgh, really?
- Yeah, more than Pittsburgh.

665
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:33,933
You know, I kept all
our home movies in a box.

666
00:56:35,518 --> 00:56:38,813
How about we make dinner
and watch them tonight?

667
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:42,150
- Yeah, that be awesome.
- Good.

668
00:56:43,776 --> 00:56:46,946
Oh, shoot, I forgot.
I have to go to Karina's tonight.

669
00:56:47,113 --> 00:56:49,157
- Who?
- Karina, she's my lab partner.

670
00:56:49,324 --> 00:56:52,827
We're doing a science project together.
I'm going to spend the night.

671
00:56:52,994 --> 00:56:55,830
- On a school night?
- Yeah. I'm sorry, Ethan, I'm really sorry.

672
00:56:55,997 --> 00:56:58,541
No, it's okay. It's just...

673
00:56:58,708 --> 00:57:00,585
Don't I need to call her parents first?

674
00:57:00,752 --> 00:57:02,670
Yeah, if you speak Russian.

675
00:57:02,837 --> 00:57:05,256
That's all her parents understand.

676
00:57:05,423 --> 00:57:07,108
Look, call Mom.
She'll tell you it's cool.

677
00:57:07,175 --> 00:57:09,886
I don't need to call your mom.

678
00:57:11,387 --> 00:57:13,556
- Can we watch those movies tomorrow?
- Yeah, sure.

679
00:57:14,724 --> 00:57:16,309
See you later.

680
00:57:18,895 --> 00:57:21,456
<i>Hi, this is Christine, I'm not here,
so please leave a message.</i>

681
00:57:21,522 --> 00:57:23,149
Tina, it's me.

682
00:57:24,817 --> 00:57:28,196
Can you believe Zooey and I
hung out on flying chairs

683
00:57:28,363 --> 00:57:32,408
and we had hot chocolate
and it was her idea?

684
00:57:32,575 --> 00:57:38,164
Thanks for all this, Tina.
You're a really great mom.

685
00:59:55,176 --> 00:59:57,637
<i>Hi, I'm thrilled
everything's going so well.</i>

686
00:59:57,803 --> 00:59:59,388
<i>But, uh, who is this friend?</i>

687
00:59:59,555 --> 01:00:01,974
<i>Well, I've never heard of her
nor her Russian parents.</i>

688
01:00:02,141 --> 01:00:03,643
<i>Anyways, give me a call.</i>

689
01:00:28,417 --> 01:00:30,086
Zooey!

690
01:01:01,993 --> 01:01:03,661
<i>Non, non.</i>

691
01:01:44,493 --> 01:01:46,287
Son of a bitch!

692
01:02:03,054 --> 01:02:04,430
Is this your car?

693
01:02:07,975 --> 01:02:10,978
Pardon... Is this your car?

694
01:02:11,145 --> 01:02:12,396
- Whoa.
- No.

695
01:02:50,059 --> 01:02:52,937
Hey! You know the rule.

696
01:02:53,104 --> 01:02:54,438
Never involve family.

697
01:02:54,605 --> 01:02:56,816
This isn't a business meeting,
Mitat, this is...

698
01:02:59,944 --> 01:03:03,489
This is more of a
father-to-father type of visit.

699
01:03:03,656 --> 01:03:05,241
- It's dinner time.
- Mitat?

700
01:03:11,288 --> 01:03:14,041
- Do you know this man, Mitat?
- Yeah, we work together.

701
01:03:15,543 --> 01:03:18,129
- Never seen him before.
- It's an American.

702
01:03:23,551 --> 01:03:26,554
Okay. Come, come with us.

703
01:03:26,721 --> 01:03:27,763
Thanks for that.

704
01:03:27,930 --> 01:03:30,307
This is Rachelle, Sarah.

705
01:03:30,474 --> 01:03:32,852
I have a serious problem
with my daughter, Zooey.

706
01:03:33,018 --> 01:03:35,813
You've been gone for five years
and you did not expect trouble?

707
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:38,221
- We cannot help you.
- That's right, you probably can't.

708
01:03:38,274 --> 01:03:39,859
But your girls might
be able to tell me where

709
01:03:40,025 --> 01:03:43,320
a 16-year-old would go
to party on a school night.

710
01:03:45,072 --> 01:03:47,700
What does this "spider" mean?

711
01:03:50,536 --> 01:03:53,372
They are good girls,
they do not party.

712
01:03:53,539 --> 01:03:54,999
What does this "spider" mean?

713
01:03:58,502 --> 01:03:59,712
La Soiree House.

714
01:03:59,879 --> 01:04:02,047
- How do you know that?
- Thank you.

715
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:09,513
I have a daughter in there.

716
01:04:26,271 --> 01:04:27,948
Zooey.

717
01:04:28,783 --> 01:04:29,700
<i>Oui.</i>

718
01:04:54,308 --> 01:04:55,309
Zooey!

719
01:05:09,323 --> 01:05:10,950
Stop, please, please.

720
01:05:23,546 --> 01:05:24,672
Stop, please.

721
01:05:34,306 --> 01:05:35,474
Ethan!

722
01:05:38,936 --> 01:05:40,020
Ethan!

723
01:05:45,901 --> 01:05:47,361
Ethan! Please!

724
01:06:09,967 --> 01:06:11,802
Come on, Zooey. Come on.

725
01:06:13,804 --> 01:06:14,888
I got you, honey.

726
01:06:39,038 --> 01:06:40,247
What are you doing here?

727
01:06:42,291 --> 01:06:45,127
Better question, Zooey, is,
what were you doing last night?

728
01:06:48,714 --> 01:06:52,092
God, this is so embarrassing.
They'll never let me in there again.

729
01:06:53,761 --> 01:06:57,014
Why would you ever want to go
back to a place like that?

730
01:06:57,181 --> 01:06:59,433
Because I like
being with my friends.

731
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:00,893
Your friends?

732
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:03,354
Do you even remember
what happened?

733
01:07:06,065 --> 01:07:07,524
In the bathroom?

734
01:07:11,236 --> 01:07:12,529
- Zooey!
- What?

735
01:07:12,696 --> 01:07:15,157
In the bathroom,
do you remember what happened?

736
01:07:15,324 --> 01:07:17,910
Look, Karina and I
aced the practice test, okay?

737
01:07:19,787 --> 01:07:21,580
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, we did.

738
01:07:21,747 --> 01:07:23,957
So we decided to go hang out
with some friends.

739
01:07:25,501 --> 01:07:27,503
I've gotta go catch the metro,
I'm gonna be late for school.

740
01:07:27,670 --> 01:07:30,214
- You're not going to the metro.
- What?

741
01:07:30,381 --> 01:07:33,175
You're not going to school today.
Not dressed like that.

742
01:07:34,468 --> 01:07:37,638
You're putting this on
and we're going home.

743
01:07:37,805 --> 01:07:40,641
- We're gonna have a talk.
- How exactly am I supposed to get home?

744
01:07:40,808 --> 01:07:42,851
- Gonna ride this bike.
- I don't think so, Ethan.

745
01:07:43,018 --> 01:07:45,396
You're getting on this bike and I'm gonna
follow you every step of the way.

746
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:48,732
- No, you're not.
- Stop talking and get on the bike.

747
01:07:48,899 --> 01:07:51,235
I thought that's what you
wanted to do, Ethan, talk!

748
01:07:51,402 --> 01:07:53,278
Get on this bike.

749
01:07:53,445 --> 01:07:55,322
- Or what?
- Now!

750
01:07:58,701 --> 01:08:00,994
I don't even know how
to ride a bike, okay?

751
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:12,172
What kind of kid doesn't know
how to ride a bike?

752
01:08:16,844 --> 01:08:20,305
The kind of kid who never
had a father to teach her.

753
01:08:26,687 --> 01:08:28,230
Goddamn it.

754
01:08:29,648 --> 01:08:31,775
This is the flattest spot,
so let's just try it right here.

755
01:08:31,942 --> 01:08:33,862
Gosh, did you have to get
the biggest bike there?

756
01:08:33,902 --> 01:08:37,906
It's not the biggest bike,
Zooey, it's a girl's bike.

757
01:08:38,073 --> 01:08:40,284
Right, you picked it
'cause it had the big bow on it.

758
01:08:40,451 --> 01:08:44,538
No. I can explain the big bow,
I got it. Get on.

759
01:08:44,705 --> 01:08:47,708
There's too many people.
Look, can we go somewhere private?

760
01:08:47,875 --> 01:08:49,543
- Gosh.
- There's not too many people.

761
01:08:51,211 --> 01:08:52,463
But it's purple.

762
01:08:54,465 --> 01:08:56,967
It is purple. Get on.

763
01:08:57,134 --> 01:09:00,763
- How do you even get on it?
- Just get on.

764
01:09:01,013 --> 01:09:03,891
Wow, we did it.
We're halfway there. We're on it.

765
01:09:05,225 --> 01:09:08,771
Give yourself time to push here, okay?
It's right here then. All right?

766
01:09:08,937 --> 01:09:10,063
Zooey, all right.

767
01:09:10,230 --> 01:09:11,648
- Whoa. Okay?
- Okay.

768
01:09:13,358 --> 01:09:14,735
- Good.
- Easy, please.

769
01:09:14,902 --> 01:09:16,904
Okay, I have you. Now, just kinda,
you know how to pedal.

770
01:09:17,070 --> 01:09:19,239
- Yes. I'm right here.
- Why is it so high?

771
01:09:20,449 --> 01:09:22,326
Don't let go. I'm gonna...

772
01:09:27,539 --> 01:09:29,958
Why did you leave us, Ethan?

773
01:09:31,168 --> 01:09:32,669
Why did you leave me and Mom?

774
01:09:34,671 --> 01:09:37,549
Look, I traveled a lot, sweetheart,
and your mother and I...

775
01:09:37,716 --> 01:09:39,426
What?

776
01:09:40,469 --> 01:09:42,221
There is no easy...

777
01:09:44,598 --> 01:09:46,266
There's no good answer, honey.

778
01:09:50,437 --> 01:09:51,438
All right.

779
01:09:51,605 --> 01:09:55,400
- Do you have another family?
- No. No, sweetheart. I didn't. Come on.

780
01:09:55,567 --> 01:09:56,735
Do you have another family?

781
01:09:56,902 --> 01:09:58,003
- Is that what it is?
- No.

782
01:09:58,070 --> 01:10:00,005
Do you have another
perfect daughter somewhere?

783
01:10:00,072 --> 01:10:01,949
Did you see me and not want me?

784
01:10:02,115 --> 01:10:04,535
- Do you not love me?
- No, sweetheart, no, that's not it.

785
01:10:08,997 --> 01:10:11,124
Well, why did it take so long
for you to come back?

786
01:10:12,459 --> 01:10:13,669
Look!

787
01:10:13,836 --> 01:10:15,420
The longer I was gone...

788
01:10:15,587 --> 01:10:18,549
...it felt like the harder
it was to come back.

789
01:10:29,810 --> 01:10:31,979
Okay, okay, all right.

790
01:10:33,856 --> 01:10:37,359
That's all.
It's nothing to do with you.

791
01:10:39,653 --> 01:10:42,281
Would you still care about me
if I did horrible things?

792
01:10:42,447 --> 01:10:43,740
Yes, of course.

793
01:10:45,033 --> 01:10:47,411
Absolutely.

794
01:10:47,578 --> 01:10:50,998
I lie a lot.
Like, all the time about everything.

795
01:10:51,164 --> 01:10:53,625
Even when I don't need to.
I don't know why.

796
01:10:53,792 --> 01:10:58,714
Well, you know, sometimes that's
easier than telling the truth.

797
01:10:58,881 --> 01:11:02,217
That girl I hit at school,
she wasn't teasing a Pakistani friend.

798
01:11:02,384 --> 01:11:04,303
She was hitting on Hugh.

799
01:11:04,469 --> 01:11:06,513
- It's all right, he prefers soccer.
- Yeah.

800
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:07,806
Hugh!

801
01:11:10,267 --> 01:11:12,311
These are so beautiful, thank you!

802
01:11:12,477 --> 01:11:14,438
Give me one sec, I'll be right back.

803
01:11:14,605 --> 01:11:16,815
Ethan, don't say anything weird.

804
01:11:21,612 --> 01:11:24,448
- You rave, Hugh?
- What?

805
01:11:24,615 --> 01:11:28,035
- You rave?
- No, no way, Mr. Zoe.

806
01:11:28,201 --> 01:11:31,079
I'm an athlete.
I'm a striker.

807
01:11:31,246 --> 01:11:33,415
Last game I scored two goals,
by the way.

808
01:11:34,666 --> 01:11:38,128
- So you like to score?
- Yeah, yeah, definitely, yeah.

809
01:11:38,962 --> 01:11:42,382
No! Well, I...
I mean on the field.

810
01:11:42,549 --> 01:11:44,259
- Yeah.
- On the field only, yeah.

811
01:11:44,426 --> 01:11:47,012
- Soccer?
- Yeah.

812
01:11:47,179 --> 01:11:50,766
Not a fan. I'm from Pittsburgh,
where we play real football.

813
01:11:50,933 --> 01:11:54,019
- Oh yeah, American football.
- No.

814
01:11:54,895 --> 01:11:56,229
Real football.

815
01:11:58,607 --> 01:11:59,608
Okay.

816
01:12:03,570 --> 01:12:04,821
Nice bike.

817
01:12:04,988 --> 01:12:06,782
- You like the bike?
- Yeah.

818
01:12:06,949 --> 01:12:08,283
You're the only one.

819
01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:13,997
I won't be home late, Ethan.

820
01:12:14,164 --> 01:12:17,501
- Where are you two going?
- School.

821
01:12:17,668 --> 01:12:19,711
Great, well,
I'm headed that direction myself.

822
01:12:19,878 --> 01:12:21,213
No, you're not.

823
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:23,423
Yeah, well, I could be.
I'm going to the market.

824
01:12:23,590 --> 01:12:25,676
Oh, okay, well, I'm gonna...

825
01:12:25,842 --> 01:12:28,303
OK, see you later,
Mr. Zooey.

826
01:12:29,972 --> 01:12:31,682
I don't like being called that.

827
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:33,141
You don't like Hugh?

828
01:12:33,608 --> 01:12:37,062
I'm in, uh, sales, sweetie.

829
01:12:37,229 --> 01:12:40,774
It's my business to read people.

830
01:12:40,941 --> 01:12:43,235
You know, a lot of my friends' dads
are in sales, Ethan,

831
01:12:43,402 --> 01:12:45,946
and not one of them
dresses like you.

832
01:12:46,113 --> 01:12:49,157
What are you saying?

833
01:12:49,324 --> 01:12:52,411
I'm saying they wear suits.
That's what they wear to work.

834
01:12:59,710 --> 01:13:01,628
Hey, I love you!

835
01:13:04,923 --> 01:13:08,844
- Haven't I helped you enough?
- You know the drill.

836
01:13:09,344 --> 01:13:12,097
The accountant checked out.
I need you to tell me where he is now.

837
01:13:12,264 --> 01:13:14,307
- I gave him to you yesterday.
- I know you did.

838
01:13:14,474 --> 01:13:16,768
And now you're back.
I thought you were a pro.

839
01:13:16,935 --> 01:13:20,397
I'm suddenly a single dad.
It's getting complicated.

840
01:13:20,564 --> 01:13:23,608
Is it my fault if your daughter
is out of control

841
01:13:23,775 --> 01:13:25,360
and affecting your work and judgment?

842
01:13:25,527 --> 01:13:27,738
You're right, Mitat.
It is affecting my judgment.

843
01:13:27,904 --> 01:13:30,157
'Cause you should have
been dead a long time ago.

844
01:13:30,323 --> 01:13:34,453
Hey, my wife works late.
I need to pick up my girls at 4:30.

845
01:13:34,619 --> 01:13:36,872
I can't promise,
but I'll make an effort.

846
01:14:24,961 --> 01:14:25,962
Open up.

847
01:14:27,839 --> 01:14:29,549
I can't get around your mirror.

848
01:14:31,927 --> 01:14:33,720
Fine, asshole.

849
01:15:41,621 --> 01:15:42,622
Yes!

850
01:15:47,210 --> 01:15:49,212
Ethan! Ethan!

851
01:16:02,893 --> 01:16:06,396
That briefcase has the routing codes
to the Albino's accounts, doesn't it?

852
01:16:06,563 --> 01:16:07,647
Yeah.

853
01:16:09,983 --> 01:16:13,153
Do not open!
The lock has an explosive trigger.

854
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:17,240
I got the codes to the briefcase.
Give me the codes to the trigger, Guido.

855
01:16:17,407 --> 01:16:20,243
But after I give it to you,
you will kill me.

856
01:16:20,410 --> 01:16:22,662
No, but I swear to God
I'm gonna really torture you

857
01:16:22,829 --> 01:16:24,664
- if you make me count to three.
- No.

858
01:16:24,831 --> 01:16:26,458
- Okay, one...
- Oh, no.

859
01:16:26,625 --> 01:16:28,752
- ...two
- No.

860
01:16:28,919 --> 01:16:30,763
No.

861
01:16:33,506 --> 01:16:35,717
- Zooey?
- Ethan, so listen,

862
01:16:35,884 --> 01:16:37,068
I was thinking about tonight.

863
01:16:37,135 --> 01:16:40,847
Sweetie, I'm gonna be home on time for
dinner, all right? I promise. Now, can I...

864
01:16:43,558 --> 01:16:46,144
- Can I call you back?
- I want to make dinner for Hugh tonight.

865
01:16:46,311 --> 01:16:48,355
Just the two of you, like a...

866
01:16:50,565 --> 01:16:52,334
- ...romantic dinner?
- Something like that.

867
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,127
And I want to make him
real spaghetti sauce

868
01:16:54,194 --> 01:16:55,995
but I don't know what I need
besides tomatoes.

869
01:16:56,029 --> 01:16:57,580
I can't find Mom,
so I need your help.

870
01:17:03,161 --> 01:17:04,496
Just a sec, sweetie.

871
01:17:06,248 --> 01:17:07,874
Guido, are you a real Italian?

872
01:17:09,501 --> 01:17:11,211
What?

873
01:17:11,378 --> 01:17:14,714
I mean, are you a real Italian?
I mean, were you born there?

874
01:17:14,881 --> 01:17:17,884
Yes. Catania, Sicily.

875
01:17:18,051 --> 01:17:20,053
Could she have a recipe for sauce?

876
01:17:21,972 --> 01:17:23,223
Sauce?

877
01:17:23,390 --> 01:17:25,350
Yeah, sauce, you know, sauce.

878
01:17:25,517 --> 01:17:28,395
- Is that code?
- No, it's not code.

879
01:17:28,561 --> 01:17:30,561
- You just said you're a real Italian, right?
- Si.

880
01:17:30,605 --> 01:17:33,942
Si, so you must know a little
something about spaghetti sauce!

881
01:17:34,109 --> 01:17:37,779
Ah! Spaghetti sauce!
Red or white?

882
01:17:41,241 --> 01:17:43,910
- Red or white?
- Red, vegetable, not too spicy.

883
01:17:44,077 --> 01:17:45,996
Vegetarian, not too spicy.

884
01:17:46,162 --> 01:17:48,331
Okay, I know what to tell her.

885
01:17:48,498 --> 01:17:52,669
Sweetie, it just so happens I'm in a
meeting here with a real live Italian.

886
01:17:52,836 --> 01:17:54,963
His mama has a great recipe.

887
01:17:55,130 --> 01:17:57,966
He wants to give it to you.
His name is Guido.

888
01:17:58,133 --> 01:18:01,136
Why don't you say hello
to my daughter.

889
01:18:02,512 --> 01:18:05,098
Hello. I am Guido.

890
01:18:05,265 --> 01:18:06,866
Hi, Guido,
this will only take a second.

891
01:18:06,933 --> 01:18:07,934
No, no!

892
01:18:08,101 --> 01:18:10,979
- Please take all the time you want.
- Who's Guido?

893
01:18:11,146 --> 01:18:13,481
No, no, no.

894
01:18:13,648 --> 01:18:18,194
So, this is my mama's favorite
reduction sauce.

895
01:18:18,361 --> 01:18:23,533
You will need tomatoes,
capers and garlic.

896
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:26,745
She always uses tomatoes
from her garden.

897
01:18:26,911 --> 01:18:29,039
Your mom has a garden?
That is so cool.

898
01:18:29,205 --> 01:18:33,251
Yes, she worked all her life
so I could go to school,

899
01:18:33,418 --> 01:18:37,797
and now I am the only one left
to take care of her.

900
01:18:41,426 --> 01:18:42,719
What else, Guido?

901
01:18:44,346 --> 01:18:49,351
Heat the olive oil,
crush the garlic.

902
01:18:49,517 --> 01:18:52,020
Then you peel the tomatoes.

903
01:18:52,187 --> 01:18:54,481
After ten minutes, no more,

904
01:18:54,647 --> 01:18:57,776
add capers and parsley.

905
01:18:57,942 --> 01:19:01,988
And my mama's secret
is a cup of red wine

906
01:19:02,155 --> 01:19:04,240
and a teaspoon of sugar.

907
01:19:05,784 --> 01:19:09,037
Boy, that Guido's a real mama's boy, huh?

908
01:19:09,204 --> 01:19:12,290
I think it's sweet that he
loves his mother. Thanks, Ethan.

909
01:19:12,457 --> 01:19:16,336
- Remember, don't get home too early.
- Okay.

910
01:19:17,504 --> 01:19:19,756
No, wait!

911
01:19:19,923 --> 01:19:22,258
Oh, please call her back.

912
01:19:22,425 --> 01:19:26,721
I wanted to give her my mama's
favorite recipe for cannoli.

913
01:19:28,431 --> 01:19:29,808
You know how to tell time?

914
01:19:31,393 --> 01:19:32,477
Where's the one?

915
01:19:34,687 --> 01:19:35,772
Where's the three?

916
01:19:37,273 --> 01:19:39,025
That's two hours.

917
01:19:39,192 --> 01:19:41,569
You cut this guy loose
in two hours.

918
01:19:41,736 --> 01:19:45,031
Guido, remind me where you're going
after this kid lets you go.

919
01:19:45,198 --> 01:19:48,201
I'm going back home
to live with Mama!

920
01:20:26,364 --> 01:20:28,074
You're late.

921
01:20:30,577 --> 01:20:32,370
I'm in the middle
of a training session.

922
01:20:33,163 --> 01:20:36,791
Yeah, I... I can see that.

923
01:20:46,301 --> 01:20:47,677
Job's done.

924
01:20:51,306 --> 01:20:53,391
- You're no fun.
- Not really.

925
01:20:53,558 --> 01:20:54,976
Sit down.

926
01:20:56,269 --> 01:20:57,937
Or did you forget why you came?

927
01:21:03,485 --> 01:21:06,279
- Champagne?
- I don't think so.

928
01:21:07,405 --> 01:21:11,117
You're just an American girl having
a good time in Paris, aren't you?

929
01:21:11,284 --> 01:21:13,328
Who doesn't love Paris?

930
01:21:13,495 --> 01:21:15,288
Now that we've bankrupted the Albino,

931
01:21:15,455 --> 01:21:18,374
he'll come running back to Paris
with his tail between his legs,

932
01:21:18,541 --> 01:21:21,419
leading us straight to the Wolf.

933
01:21:21,586 --> 01:21:23,171
When?

934
01:21:24,547 --> 01:21:26,007
Very soon.

935
01:22:10,426 --> 01:22:11,970
You can't go dressed like that.

936
01:22:17,183 --> 01:22:19,644
What's wrong with how I dress?

937
01:22:19,811 --> 01:22:22,522
What are you, cheri, 42 long?

938
01:22:24,065 --> 01:22:25,108
Yes.

939
01:22:25,275 --> 01:22:27,443
- Take it off.
- Excuse me?

940
01:22:29,529 --> 01:22:31,239
Shoes, everything. Let's go.

941
01:22:53,678 --> 01:22:56,556
- What's going on?
- Baby.

942
01:22:56,723 --> 01:22:57,932
Baby?

943
01:23:01,060 --> 01:23:04,355
You let that guy go, right?
You didn't hurt him?

944
01:23:06,232 --> 01:23:10,194
No, you keep that,
that's yours now.

945
01:23:43,853 --> 01:23:45,480
My God.

946
01:23:45,647 --> 01:23:47,540
This is not the first time
for you, after all.

947
01:23:49,317 --> 01:23:51,152
Actually, it is.

948
01:23:51,319 --> 01:23:52,779
What about your daughter?

949
01:23:55,198 --> 01:23:57,867
I wasn't there.

950
01:23:58,034 --> 01:24:03,331
I was working far away,
in Africa to be precise.

951
01:24:06,334 --> 01:24:07,877
You were doing good?

952
01:24:10,588 --> 01:24:12,006
I don't even remember.

953
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:18,905
The baby is coming!

954
01:24:26,396 --> 01:24:27,814
It is a girl.

955
01:24:38,783 --> 01:24:41,536
Before the baby leaves the house
for the first time,

956
01:24:41,703 --> 01:24:46,207
it is our custom to have
the family offer a blessing.

957
01:24:47,959 --> 01:24:50,670
- Leave?
- Yes.

958
01:24:50,837 --> 01:24:55,383
- We are keeping our word to you.
- Word?

959
01:24:55,550 --> 01:24:58,094
What word? I mean,
I just I brought Chinese, okay?

960
01:24:58,261 --> 01:25:00,304
I've got a 100 fortune cookies.

961
01:25:00,471 --> 01:25:03,933
It's okay.
Everything is as it should be.

962
01:25:06,769 --> 01:25:09,831
Look, I didn't mean for you to have
to leave right after the child was born.

963
01:25:09,897 --> 01:25:12,525
I mean, there's plenty of room
for everyone.

964
01:25:13,776 --> 01:25:15,611
Maybe it's too much room.

965
01:25:15,778 --> 01:25:20,616
My wife wants a smaller place
out of the city. No guests.

966
01:25:20,783 --> 01:25:22,702
Just us and the children.

967
01:25:22,869 --> 01:25:26,581
It is good
as long as we are together.

968
01:25:26,748 --> 01:25:29,792
Sumia wants to call the baby Ethan.

969
01:25:37,633 --> 01:25:41,512
- It's a boy's name.
- No.

970
01:25:41,679 --> 01:25:44,724
It's the name of a great man
who didn't shoot us when he could.

971
01:25:44,891 --> 01:25:46,851
And instead gave us his home.

972
01:25:47,018 --> 01:25:48,895
She has chosen carefully.

973
01:25:50,521 --> 01:25:52,148
The name is perfect.

974
01:26:47,203 --> 01:26:49,580
Hey, how did it go?

975
01:26:49,747 --> 01:26:51,290
Hugh asked me to go to the prom.

976
01:26:51,457 --> 01:26:53,543
Good.

977
01:26:53,709 --> 01:26:55,670
So dinner was a success.

978
01:26:57,797 --> 01:27:01,384
Wow. You look nice.

979
01:27:02,718 --> 01:27:04,128
Did you wear that for me today?

980
01:27:05,972 --> 01:27:08,391
Uh... no. I had to...

981
01:27:08,558 --> 01:27:09,934
I had to give a speech.

982
01:27:10,101 --> 01:27:12,103
Are you coming to the pre-party tomorrow?

983
01:27:12,270 --> 01:27:14,981
Well, I am if you're asking.

984
01:27:15,147 --> 01:27:17,191
It's on Hugh's father's rooftop.

985
01:27:17,358 --> 01:27:20,111
You know Hugh comes from
a really cultured family.

986
01:27:20,278 --> 01:27:21,112
Yeah.

987
01:27:23,739 --> 01:27:27,285
Don't forget you've got Steelers blood
running through your veins.

988
01:27:32,415 --> 01:27:36,627
They sent Hugh to a special school to learn
how to dance when he was like eight.

989
01:27:37,295 --> 01:27:38,921
So?

990
01:27:39,088 --> 01:27:41,591
So that means he's probably
a really good dancer.

991
01:27:41,757 --> 01:27:43,342
So?

992
01:27:43,509 --> 01:27:47,013
So I don't know how to dance
like that, Ethan.

993
01:28:01,027 --> 01:28:03,112
- No.
- Come on.

994
01:28:03,279 --> 01:28:05,656
- I'm not gonna dance.
- You can stand on my feet.

995
01:28:07,325 --> 01:28:09,118
- I'm too big for this.
- You're not too big.

996
01:28:09,285 --> 01:28:11,579
Now, stand on my feet.

997
01:28:12,955 --> 01:28:15,583
I'm gonna teach you how to dance
to your mother's favorite song.

998
01:28:15,750 --> 01:28:17,376
Okay.

999
01:28:17,543 --> 01:28:20,338
There and back.

1000
01:28:22,089 --> 01:28:24,842
- Pretty easy, huh?
- Not too bad.

1001
01:28:25,009 --> 01:28:28,763
Now get off.

1002
01:28:38,981 --> 01:28:42,443
Would you wear this suit
tomorrow for me?

1003
01:28:44,070 --> 01:28:46,155
Of course I would.

1004
01:29:08,219 --> 01:29:09,595
Mom.

1005
01:29:16,143 --> 01:29:17,895
Sweetie.

1006
01:29:20,898 --> 01:29:24,568
You haven't coughed.
Not since I've been back.

1007
01:29:24,735 --> 01:29:26,654
How are you feeling?

1008
01:29:26,821 --> 01:29:29,990
Remember when I'd bring Zooey
to school in the first grade?

1009
01:29:30,157 --> 01:29:31,992
She had that stuffed rabbit.

1010
01:29:32,159 --> 01:29:33,452
Lamby the lamb.

1011
01:29:35,037 --> 01:29:37,248
Right, Lamby the lamb.

1012
01:29:38,791 --> 01:29:41,252
I remember the day
she never took him to school again.

1013
01:29:41,419 --> 01:29:46,632
My stomach hurt that day.
That's how I feel now.

1014
01:29:46,799 --> 01:29:49,635
- Like you lost something.
- Yeah.

1015
01:29:49,802 --> 01:29:53,264
- Have you told her yet?
- No.

1016
01:29:55,558 --> 01:29:59,103
- You're gonna have to.
- I know.

1017
01:30:00,187 --> 01:30:02,022
Just tell her you love her.

1018
01:30:02,189 --> 01:30:04,275
She knows.

1019
01:30:04,442 --> 01:30:07,903
She needs to hear it from you.

1020
01:30:08,070 --> 01:30:12,158
Of course I love her.
I mean, I love her the same way...

1021
01:30:14,201 --> 01:30:15,828
...the same way I love you.

1022
01:31:08,964 --> 01:31:10,132
Good morning.

1023
01:31:10,299 --> 01:31:11,509
Oh, God.

1024
01:31:12,927 --> 01:31:16,055
- You're not on the couch.
- No, Tina, I'm not on the couch.

1025
01:31:16,222 --> 01:31:17,848
Good morning, parents.

1026
01:31:19,266 --> 01:31:21,685
Wow, sweetheart.
What a good idea. Here.

1027
01:31:21,852 --> 01:31:24,146
Bring that orange juice right here.

1028
01:31:24,313 --> 01:31:27,066
Sweetie, just put down the tray,
I'll meet you in the kitchen. Okay?

1029
01:31:27,233 --> 01:31:29,401
Come on,
I squeezed the oranges all by myself.

1030
01:31:29,568 --> 01:31:30,611
Now, please.

1031
01:31:33,405 --> 01:31:35,491
What's wrong, Mom?
You're acting really weird.

1032
01:31:35,658 --> 01:31:39,328
Nothing, sweetie. Just go finish getting
dressed and I'll take you to school.

1033
01:31:39,495 --> 01:31:41,956
Come on, let' go. Go.

1034
01:31:42,122 --> 01:31:43,541
Love you, Mom.

1035
01:31:43,707 --> 01:31:45,209
I love you, sweetie.

1036
01:31:47,753 --> 01:31:50,506
What's wrong with her seeing us?

1037
01:31:50,673 --> 01:31:52,716
Really.

1038
01:31:57,179 --> 01:31:58,472
What happens when you're gone?

1039
01:32:07,314 --> 01:32:08,357
Yeah?

1040
01:32:08,524 --> 01:32:10,693
The Albino is staying
at the Grand Hotel.

1041
01:32:13,195 --> 01:32:14,280
All right.

1042
01:32:18,784 --> 01:32:23,038
Hey. I'm not going anywhere.

1043
01:33:04,330 --> 01:33:06,332
- Hello.
- You spotted me.

1044
01:33:06,498 --> 01:33:09,460
- I'd have to be blind not to.
- Don't do anything stupid, Mitat.

1045
01:33:09,627 --> 01:33:11,503
Your girls are expecting you
home tonight.

1046
01:33:11,670 --> 01:33:13,839
So is your beautiful wife.

1047
01:33:16,050 --> 01:33:17,718
Who were you talking to?

1048
01:33:37,863 --> 01:33:38,906
Come on, accelerate!

1049
01:33:45,245 --> 01:33:46,330
Come on!

1050
01:34:03,389 --> 01:34:04,640
Come on, faster!

1051
01:35:13,542 --> 01:35:14,793
Have we lost him?

1052
01:35:22,092 --> 01:35:24,136
This kind of guy,
he'd never give up.

1053
01:36:01,090 --> 01:36:02,758
Why you don't kill me already?

1054
01:36:04,968 --> 01:36:08,013
Because you're the father who knows best.

1055
01:38:17,559 --> 01:38:18,852
Just kill him!

1056
01:38:47,214 --> 01:38:48,215
Vivi...

1057
01:39:27,838 --> 01:39:29,214
Welcome back.

1058
01:39:42,144 --> 01:39:44,313
You let the Wolf
slip through your hands again.

1059
01:39:45,814 --> 01:39:46,857
Where am I?

1060
01:39:47,816 --> 01:39:49,151
A safe place.

1061
01:39:52,029 --> 01:39:54,531
We got your lab results
back today, Ethan.

1062
01:39:54,698 --> 01:39:58,368
I was actually pretty curious myself.
And as it turns out,

1063
01:39:58,535 --> 01:40:01,580
it looks like the treatment's
having a positive effect on you.

1064
01:40:09,546 --> 01:40:12,132
It's my wife. Hello?

1065
01:40:12,299 --> 01:40:14,176
Hi. Where are you?

1066
01:40:14,342 --> 01:40:15,510
Um...

1067
01:40:16,636 --> 01:40:18,221
I'm leaving the doctor's office now.

1068
01:40:18,388 --> 01:40:21,892
Hurry up and get home.
We're gonna be late for Zooey's party.

1069
01:40:22,059 --> 01:40:23,518
Okay.

1070
01:40:26,229 --> 01:40:30,442
I don't want to spend the rest of my life
killing for you, Vivi.

1071
01:40:30,609 --> 01:40:32,402
You're almost there, Ethan.

1072
01:40:34,613 --> 01:40:35,697
Kill the Wolf.

1073
01:40:38,825 --> 01:40:40,452
I'm gonna need a new suit.

1074
01:40:43,205 --> 01:40:44,873
You heard him.

1075
01:40:51,838 --> 01:40:55,759
There has been a change in plans.
We're leaving tonight.

1076
01:40:55,926 --> 01:40:58,428
Take me to my partner's house.

1077
01:40:58,595 --> 01:41:00,764
He will help me to get out of Paris.

1078
01:41:03,767 --> 01:41:06,603
- Mom, don't ruin my night.
- Why don't you try them on?

1079
01:41:06,770 --> 01:41:08,647
No!

1080
01:41:09,940 --> 01:41:12,526
- Listen, just at least try them on?
- No!

1081
01:41:21,159 --> 01:41:22,160
Whoa!

1082
01:41:26,706 --> 01:41:29,417
Just smile and have fun.

1083
01:41:29,584 --> 01:41:33,088
Why? I hate these shoes.
I look like Little Miss Sunshine.

1084
01:41:39,511 --> 01:41:41,346
- You look great, honey.
- No, I don't.

1085
01:41:51,565 --> 01:41:53,900
- Zoe.
- Hugh.

1086
01:41:54,067 --> 01:41:56,111
- You look great.
- Really, I do?

1087
01:41:56,278 --> 01:41:57,320
Yeah, of course.

1088
01:41:59,990 --> 01:42:02,617
Oh, Mr. Renner, Mrs. Renner,

1089
01:42:03,034 --> 01:42:04,202
these are my parents.

1090
01:42:04,369 --> 01:42:06,371
Nice to see you again.
Thanks for inviting us.

1091
01:42:06,538 --> 01:42:08,039
You're welcome.

1092
01:42:08,206 --> 01:42:10,083
This is Ethan, Zooey's dad.

1093
01:42:10,250 --> 01:42:12,252
Hi. And this is my partner.

1094
01:42:16,715 --> 01:42:18,216
Pleasure to meet you.

1095
01:42:21,094 --> 01:42:22,262
And you.

1096
01:42:23,096 --> 01:42:25,640
If it wasn't for this party,
we might never have met.

1097
01:42:29,269 --> 01:42:30,270
How do you do?

1098
01:42:37,569 --> 01:42:38,486
Wow.

1099
01:42:38,653 --> 01:42:39,863
Yeah, wow.

1100
01:42:40,030 --> 01:42:42,449
Kids.

1101
01:42:58,882 --> 01:43:00,258
Wow.

1102
01:43:01,801 --> 01:43:03,470
- May I take this? Thank you, sir.
- Yeah.

1103
01:43:16,524 --> 01:43:18,151
Isn't this great?

1104
01:43:18,318 --> 01:43:19,569
Yeah.

1105
01:43:21,321 --> 01:43:22,948
Zooey, do me a favor.

1106
01:43:24,115 --> 01:43:26,326
Try and use your best
judgment with Hugh tonight.

1107
01:43:36,586 --> 01:43:37,587
Cheers.

1108
01:43:52,060 --> 01:43:53,478
You're working again!

1109
01:43:55,355 --> 01:43:58,358
Yeah. There's a problem here.

1110
01:44:00,485 --> 01:44:03,238
That's why you came back to Paris?

1111
01:44:03,405 --> 01:44:06,700
No. I came back to see you and Zooey.

1112
01:44:06,866 --> 01:44:08,493
It was all a lie.

1113
01:44:08,660 --> 01:44:10,954
You promised you'd keep
your work away from us.

1114
01:44:11,121 --> 01:44:14,165
- You're probably not even sick.
- It's not a lie, Tina.

1115
01:44:14,332 --> 01:44:16,501
Right now I don't
have the time to explain.

1116
01:44:36,479 --> 01:44:38,982
How many guys do we have?

1117
01:44:42,819 --> 01:44:45,613
The police will be here
in ten minutes.

1118
01:44:45,780 --> 01:44:47,824
- You all right?
- No.

1119
01:44:47,991 --> 01:44:50,952
No, I'm not so good.
I've gotta go...

1120
01:44:52,162 --> 01:44:54,789
If we go now, there is enough time.

1121
01:44:58,001 --> 01:45:01,004
Okay. This party's over.

1122
01:45:05,383 --> 01:45:07,469
- You used us both!
- No, I would never do that.

1123
01:45:07,635 --> 01:45:09,554
I'll get my funds, bring everyone in.

1124
01:45:09,721 --> 01:45:11,681
Make sure the street's blocked.

1125
01:45:13,141 --> 01:45:15,268
At least have the decency
to look at me.

1126
01:45:25,570 --> 01:45:26,738
Kill him.

1127
01:45:28,615 --> 01:45:29,616
It's just bad luck.

1128
01:45:31,159 --> 01:45:32,327
You're sick, Ethan.

1129
01:45:40,585 --> 01:45:43,505
Wow, this is unbelievable.

1130
01:45:43,671 --> 01:45:45,715
Yeah. I know. It's crazy.

1131
01:45:55,767 --> 01:45:57,185
I'm gonna be sick.

1132
01:45:58,186 --> 01:45:59,771
Come with me.

1133
01:46:17,247 --> 01:46:18,873
Did you scratch yourself?

1134
01:46:23,169 --> 01:46:24,729
No, please don't go.
Come home with me.

1135
01:46:24,796 --> 01:46:26,039
Just leave it to someone else.

1136
01:46:27,924 --> 01:46:29,926
Just please stay here.

1137
01:46:43,273 --> 01:46:44,482
- Zooey!
- What?

1138
01:46:44,649 --> 01:46:45,775
Get down!

1139
01:47:16,472 --> 01:47:18,057
You hear me in there?

1140
01:47:19,350 --> 01:47:20,894
I'm sending you down.

1141
01:48:32,966 --> 01:48:34,384
Oh, shit.

1142
01:48:43,142 --> 01:48:44,227
Wheel's turning.

1143
01:48:48,439 --> 01:48:50,608
No, stay, you fuckers!

1144
01:48:50,775 --> 01:48:52,694
Don't!

1145
01:49:06,874 --> 01:49:08,668
I gotta...

1146
01:49:09,585 --> 01:49:11,296
Don't.

1147
01:49:12,213 --> 01:49:13,881
I wouldn't mind killing you.

1148
01:49:16,801 --> 01:49:18,803
You scared a lot of people up there.

1149
01:49:21,681 --> 01:49:23,641
This is my daughter's party.

1150
01:49:35,069 --> 01:49:36,404
Yes.

1151
01:49:40,616 --> 01:49:41,492
Yes, come on.

1152
01:49:54,922 --> 01:49:56,215
Viv.

1153
01:49:59,010 --> 01:50:00,803
Oh, my God.

1154
01:50:04,057 --> 01:50:06,309
Am I in hell?

1155
01:50:06,476 --> 01:50:09,479
So that's what it looks like
to you, Ethan.

1156
01:50:09,645 --> 01:50:12,815
Figures.

1157
01:50:14,650 --> 01:50:17,403
- Finish it.
- What?

1158
01:50:20,073 --> 01:50:22,408
You'll do what I tell you to.

1159
01:50:22,575 --> 01:50:25,745
- No.
- Finish it.

1160
01:50:26,662 --> 01:50:29,499
I passed my quota, Vivi.

1161
01:50:30,666 --> 01:50:31,667
Ethan...

1162
01:50:31,834 --> 01:50:34,879
Jesus Christ!

1163
01:50:42,845 --> 01:50:45,264
Are you really done working for them?

1164
01:50:45,890 --> 01:50:48,518
A killer is a killer.
He'll never change.

1165
01:50:48,684 --> 01:50:50,578
I know I haven't done right
by you and Zooey.

1166
01:50:50,645 --> 01:50:52,397
Kill him.

1167
01:50:52,563 --> 01:50:53,940
I should've left a long time ago.

1168
01:50:54,107 --> 01:50:56,234
- What about your daughter?
- I wasn't there.

1169
01:50:56,401 --> 01:50:58,903
Do it.

1170
01:51:01,114 --> 01:51:03,699
What kind of kid
doesn't know how to ride a bike?

1171
01:51:03,866 --> 01:51:06,452
The kind of kid who never had
a father to teach her.

1172
01:51:08,746 --> 01:51:09,747
- Ethan.
- Ethan!

1173
01:51:11,290 --> 01:51:12,417
Do it!

1174
01:51:12,583 --> 01:51:14,085
Promise you'll never
lie to me again.

1175
01:51:15,378 --> 01:51:16,421
You have no choice.

1176
01:51:19,507 --> 01:51:21,426
I don't think so.

1177
01:51:24,303 --> 01:51:27,849
The wife wants me to give it up.

1178
01:52:07,346 --> 01:52:08,598
Can I talk to her?

1179
01:52:08,764 --> 01:52:11,559
No, she's down on the beach
right now throwing rocks.

1180
01:52:11,726 --> 01:52:14,103
- What?
- Yeah, we're...

1181
01:52:14,270 --> 01:52:15,938
We're taking a break
from each other right now.

1182
01:52:16,105 --> 01:52:18,149
At least she's not throwing them at me.

1183
01:52:18,316 --> 01:52:20,401
Is everything all right?

1184
01:52:20,568 --> 01:52:24,655
Yeah, it's been all right.
There's been good and bad days.

1185
01:52:24,822 --> 01:52:26,908
She said things, I've said things.

1186
01:52:27,074 --> 01:52:29,494
There's been some tears,

1187
01:52:29,660 --> 01:52:31,704
but the week overall's
been really worth it.

1188
01:53:05,238 --> 01:53:06,239
Hey.

1189
01:53:07,698 --> 01:53:09,909
These are some presents
from me and, um...

1190
01:53:10,076 --> 01:53:12,245
...a package that was
dropped at the house.

1191
01:53:12,411 --> 01:53:15,289
I can hear your car running.
Are you gonna go back?

1192
01:53:21,254 --> 01:53:23,005
I love you, Tina.

1193
01:53:25,508 --> 01:53:27,301
Just not enough to quit.

1194
01:53:28,344 --> 01:53:31,764
I think you're wrong,
but I understand.

1195
01:53:34,475 --> 01:53:39,981
If I could say one word to you
to change your mind,

1196
01:53:40,147 --> 01:53:42,191
would you give me that chance?

1197
01:53:42,358 --> 01:53:43,818
This isn't a game.

1198
01:53:45,152 --> 01:53:47,780
We don't have to stay in the same room,
we don't have to sleep together,

1199
01:53:47,947 --> 01:53:49,949
that's not what I'm asking.

1200
01:53:50,116 --> 01:53:53,619
If that becomes important,
you'll be the one to decide.

1201
01:53:53,786 --> 01:53:55,454
I'll hear the music, and then I'll know.

1202
01:53:55,621 --> 01:53:57,290
And if I never hear it...

1203
01:53:58,916 --> 01:54:00,918
I've already gotten more than I deserve.

1204
01:54:03,629 --> 01:54:08,718
I just wanna hang out as long as I can
with my daughter and my wife.

1205
01:54:10,845 --> 01:54:13,639
- What's the word?
- What?

1206
01:54:13,806 --> 01:54:15,308
What's the one word
to make me change my mind?

1207
01:54:15,474 --> 01:54:19,562
It's, uh... it's Christmas.

1208
01:54:22,440 --> 01:54:24,150
That's two, Ethan.

1209
01:54:24,317 --> 01:54:26,611
- Hey, Mom!
- Hi, sweetie.

1210
01:54:26,777 --> 01:54:27,987
I'm so glad you came!

1211
01:54:31,490 --> 01:54:32,992
Come on, let's go inside.

1212
01:54:34,118 --> 01:54:35,828
Dad's gonna make us hot cocoa.

1213
01:54:40,750 --> 01:54:41,834
Come on.

1214
01:55:03,022 --> 01:55:04,440
Is Dad a badass?

1215
01:55:06,442 --> 01:55:10,279
Well, he's, um...
He's done some things.

1216
01:55:15,826 --> 01:55:19,246
You think Dad's gonna stick around?

1217
01:55:19,413 --> 01:55:20,915
As long as he can, sweetheart.

1218
01:55:23,417 --> 01:55:25,044
He loves you so much.
